\title{Build an adjacency matrix for a phylogenetic tree}
\usage{
build_adjacency_matrix(tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A rooted or unrooted tree of class \code{"phylo"} (from the
\strong{ape} package).  The component \code{$edge} is assumed to index tips
in \eqn{1,\dots,N_\text{tip}} and internal nodes in
\eqn{N_\text{tip}+1,\dots,N_\text{tip}+N_\text{node}}.}
}
\value{
A square numeric matrix whose \eqn{(i,j)} entry equals 1 when nodes
  \(i\) and \(j\) are directly connected by an edge and 0 otherwise.
}
\description{
Generates a symmetric \(N \times N\) adjacency matrix that encodes the
parent–child relationships of a phylogenetic tree stored as a
\code{\link[ape]{phylo}} object.  Tip and internal node labels (when
available) are used as row and column names.
}
\details{
The routine loops over each edge of the tree and populates both \eqn{A[i,j]}
and \eqn{A[j,i]} so that the result is symmetric.  Internal nodes receive
automatic labels when \code{tree$node.label} is \code{NULL}.
}
\examples{
if (requireNamespace("ape", quietly = TRUE)) {
  set.seed(1)
  toy_tree <- ape::rtree(5)          # random 5‑tip tree
  A <- build_adjacency_matrix(toy_tree)
  A
}
