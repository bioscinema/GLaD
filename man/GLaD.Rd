\title{Graph Laplacian Distance (GLaD) for Microbiome Samples}
\usage{
GLaD(physeq, rho = 0.5, weighted = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{physeq}{A [`phyloseq`] object with a rooted phylogenetic tree.}

\item{rho}{A scalar shrinkage parameter in [0, 1); defaults to 0.5.}

\item{weighted}{Logical; if TRUE, use relative abundance, otherwise
presence/absence.}
}
\value{
A symmetric matrix of class [`dist`] containing the pairwise GLaD
  dissimilarities between samples.
}
\description{
Computes the GLaD dissimilarity matrix for samples in a [`phyloseq`] object,
incorporating phylogenetic relationships through a graph Laplacian. GLaD is
a flexible kernel-based approach that propagates tip-level abundances through
a phylogenetic tree, yielding distances that reflect both abundance and
topology.
}
\details{
The GLaD distance between samples $i$ and $j$ is computed as
  \deqn{ \sqrt{(p_i - p_j)^\top L^{-1} (p_i - p_j)} }
  where $p_i$ and $p_j$ are the full (tip + internal node) normalized
  abundance vectors and $L$ is the regularized graph Laplacian derived from
  the adjacency matrix of the phylogeny. Internal node abundances are
  calculated by summing descendants. The linear system is solved efficiently
  using sparse matrix techniques.
